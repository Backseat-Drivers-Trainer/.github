## 🧭 Overview

The trainer runs externally, using smart process mapping to safely apply boosts, control modifiers, and visual indicators without interfering with core gameplay files. Every feature can be toggled live through an in-game overlay — meaning you can focus on driving, teamwork, and precision handling without unnecessary menu navigation.

[!IMPORTANT]

> Backseat Drivers Trainer uses non-destructive read/write methods. It never alters permanent saves or system memory blocks.
